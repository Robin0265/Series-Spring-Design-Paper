This paper presents a new hybrid actuation approach that combines the use of brakes, springs and motors. The proposed actuation design is potentially safer and more energy efficient than haptic devices that only rely on motors for actuation, and also overcomes many of the rendering limitations displayed by existing passive haptic displays. Applications of this new technology range from devices where safety and reliability are of prime concerns (e.g. large force-feedback interfaces) to devices which can only be powered by limited energy sources such as small batteries (e.g. portable haptic interfaces). }

While SEAs have been used in numerous robotic systems, no comprehensive understanding of an optimal design exists. This paper presents a new analytical basis for maximizing an SEA thrust performance for jumping from rest with an articulated leg. The analytical SEA model is validated with simulation and experimental results from a prototype leg. An SEA decouples the dynamic limitations of a dc motor actuator from the joint, allowing larger lift-off velocities than with a directly driven joint. A detailed analysis of the complex dynamic response of an SEA during the thrust phase leads to a new maximum impulse criterion, where motor speed is approximately half the no-load speed at the moment of peak motor torque. The analytical model and this proposed criterion are used to develop a simple equation for selecting SEA design parameters. Lastly, a novel unidirectional SEA design is presented that allows for accurate positioning of the leg during flight.}",

    abstract = { A safe interaction is crucial in wearable robotics in general, while in assistive and rehabilitation applications, robots may also be required to minimally perturb physiological movements, ideally acting as perfectly transparent machines. The actuation system plays a central role because the expected performance, in terms of torque, speed and control bandwidth, must not be achieved at the expense of lightness and compactness. Actuators embedding compliant elements, such as series elastic actuators, can be designed to meet the above-mentioned requirements in terms of high energy storing capacity and stability of torque control. A number of series elastic actuators have been proposed over the past 20 years in order to accommodate the needs arising from specific applications. This paper presents a novel series elastic actuator intended for the actuation system of a lower limb wearable robot, recently developed in our lab. The actuator is able to deliver 300 W and has a novel architecture making its centre of mass not co-located with its axis of rotation, for an easier integration into the robotic structure. A custom-made torsion spring with a stiffness of 272.25 N·m·rad–1 is directly connected to the load. The delivered torque is calculated from the measurement of the spring deflection, through two absolute encoders. Testing on torque measurement accuracy and torque/stiffness control are reported. }
} Presents a spring design resembling CarpinoEA2012JMD, but with Long squiggling flexures in place of the empty curved slot profiles. Parameters optimized, presumably based on the FEA. Profile was wired EDMed. "High linearity was found with a stiffness value differing only 15.5\% from the one targeted in FEM analysis." "the target storable elastic energy is 7.5 J" "a novel topology was investigated, which includes a symmetric structure with a radial replication of four elastic elements (worm-shaped lamellae)." "The spring material is maraging steel 300 (Bohler W720, Young modulus: 193 GPa) selected for its high nominal yield stress (2.0 GPa) and ultimate tensile strength (2.1 GPa)" "The maximum von Mises stress is 1.01 GPa (safety factor: 2)." "The calculated arc rotation is 0.25 rad, corresponding to a torsion stiffness of 235.70 N·m·rad−1. The expected stored elastic energy is 7.64 J, while the specific energy, considering that the weight of the spring pack is 0.37 kg, is 20.58 J/kg."

    abstract = { This paper aims to present the integrated design, development, and testing procedures for a state-of-the-art torsion-based series elastic actuator that could be reliably employed for long-term use in force-controlled robot applications. The main objective in designing the actuator was to meet weight and dimensional requirements whilst improving the long-term durability, ensuring high torque output, and containing its total weight. A four-fold design approach was implemented: (i) following recursive design-and-test procedures, an optimal torsional spring topology was unveiled with the help of SIMP (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization) topology optimization method, (ii) the proposed spring was manufactured and multiple specimens were experimentally tested via a torsional test machine to validate linearity, loading rate response, and mechanical limits, (iii) the actuator’s thermal response was experimentally scrutinized to ensure that the generated heat was dissipated for long-term use, and (iv) the fatigue life of the spring was computed with the help of real-life experiment data. Having concluded the development and verification procedures, two different versions of the actuator were built, and preliminary torque control experiments were conducted. In conclusion, favorable torque tracking with a bandwidth of 19 Hz was achieved while peak-to-peak torque input was 20 Nm. }
} A monolith spring generated by computer optimization then tested to failure twice. The spring takes an essentially pure tapering cantilever design, where the tip of the canteliever is attached to a thin hoop. "Optimization algorithm was executed
on a PC with IntelVR CoreTMi7-6700 CPU running
of 3.4GHz sampling and 32 GB RAM. The
CPU time to complete the optimization run was
30 min." "Furthermore, the volume
ratio appeared to be 0.56, meaning that 44\% of the
material was removed from the initial CAD geometry." "With this final design, the
maximum stress of 435MPa at the 2deg of torsional
deflection was achieved." "The design target on torsional stiffness of 80 Nm/deg
was also achieved. Therefore, we observe that the
spring can be used as a torque sensor to measure
the torque accurately with a nonlinearity error of
5\% up to 148 Nm, 90\% of the maximum output
torque. Around the maximum torque output, the
nonlinearity error reached to its maximum 13\%;
yet, it can be decreased to 0.85\% over the entire
range via a cubic polynomial fit."

% SISO, Upper bound noise level, certain gain of the plant, time series data---but also noisy point samples of the frequency response. a-priori plant, noise, and experiment duration information is required. Untuned: algorithm is independent of a-priori information. Related to a relatively obscure branch of system identification literature: [41]-[43], 1261, [3], [52], [51]---information theory basis. All SISO. Assumes Linfinity corruption limit, equivalent to A-Priori bounded noise magnitude. The weighting matrices I seek to identify simply don't exist in SISO models. Yields a single model with bounded error from a true unique model.

I think the following papers represent potentially a "bounded noise but ultimately determanistic model" approach, as they highlight their differences from the Ljungian school of "stochastic noise".


To read and add. Especially any chapter which discusses ellipsoidal bounding.

Read this before changing the name convention and citing it. Work in this style should be aggregated and added to the introduciton. I think the difference is how the models are parameterized

Set Membership Identification---the set of un-invalidated models, but not aiming at a terminal model-set

Boyd is on a paper about set membership identification: here the team assumed the model was parameterized correctly, and then used convex optimization to find quadric bounds on the parameters (sometimes hyperbola, mostly ellipsoids). They blow the research off in the conclusion as potentially very conservative. And they went on to minimax. The discussion between equation error and prediction error suggests this is a time domain method.

Ultimately I don't like the way the book focuses on the seemingly obscure four polynomial approach---a stability criteria for polynomials with bounded coefficients. It treats robustness of systems as robustness of systems with bounded matrix coefficients, and that's not a realistic descriptor at all.

} % Uses adaptive control, considers uncertainty. Suggests that bode plot based control is limited to SISO systems, but that frequency weighting functions capture the essence of the robustness/performance tradeoff. Maybe the book is about Hinfinity loop shaping? What is loop recovery? Authors know about Hinfinity, but not about LMIs or D-region. Dual control is defined as the balance between persistant excitations needed for parameter estimation and the desire to have low output error to be a good controller. Uses the Youla Kucera parameterization, to optimize with in the space of robustly stable controllers. There is an introduced concept of the possible uncertainties of the plant, which are paramterized by the fact that the plant is stabilized by the nominal controller. Controller youla parameter Q (a stable filter) and plant youla parameter S (Dual Youla parameterization?) are important because for the system to be stable, Q must stabilize S! (and the nominal controller with Q=0 must stabilize the nominal plant with S=0). Book suggests adaptive Q. Author is aware of the iterative identification for control paradigm. Concept of nested control, recusive control, related closely to approximation by successive linear fractional expansions (as also seen in the orthonormal basis functions book!)

%There is a lesser-cited controls oriented report on the hardiman system which makes clearer the way they intended to use hydraulic actuation to enforce a zero-dynamics where the human puts in 1/25th of the force felt by the system. They don't talk about this zero dynamics explicitly in their report, but you can figure it out from their diagram: the two hydraulic cylinders have the same differential pressure but are designed with different bore radii, so a pressure differential causes a big positive force on the slave and a small negative force on the person. (If you subtract equations to get the behavior that is not influenced by the control input, you get something like $M_slave \ddot \theta_slave + \alpha M_master \ddot \theta_master = \tau_environment + \alpha \tau_human$ with $\alpha$ about equal to 25.) The rest of their controller is all about high performance angle matching; given their actuation system, any controller that stabilizes the angle difference will enforce the desired amplification behavior.

Gantry human assistance admittance controller.
Differentiates acceleration and deceleration (to use a brake?)
Discusses the choice between admittance and impedance control, essentially choosing admittance control because the human isn't able to move the deivce (as the input). I'd say this is a false choice here. A good disturbance observer could also remove the nonlinearity that prevent the operator from backdriving the device.

UCSC 7-DOF exoskeleton robot.
PD+neural vs PID: answer is PID+neural
Goes to great length to refine the position control performance of a mid-layer position controller
Proofs on stability of the position controller alone
Only the hand is used for the control command (of the three cuffs)
Does not elaborate on the admittance chosen, or the constraints on the admittance.

%Body Extender [Fontana et al 2014 RAM] uses admittance control, but they call it "A user specified Impedance"
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6990863
Some other notes from the conclusion of that paper mention the limitations of the body extender system:
Difficulties in bimanual manipulation: Stable bimanual manipulation of loads requires more advanced controllers that consider the mutual interaction of robot arms with the object (this is particularly critical for the manipulation of stiff objects).
Slow speed of the machine: The machine is quite slow mainly due to the excessive prudence of the user, who needs to focus too much to keep the system in equilibrium, and due to hardware limitations given by the relatively low maximum ratings of motor speed (especially for the leg joints).

%I think we should pay careful attention to the upper-body amplification exoskeleton community, because they are more likely to have good theoretical frameworks that have worked in practice and were published. (since upper body exoskeletons are easier to get to work. Hardiman's team claimed that their upper body basically worked.)

% investigates passivity for multiple control schemes. Casscaded contrl with inner velocity loop is chosen. Design process allows "proceeding from the inside to the outside" Boden cable exo hardawre. Block diagram is only of the motor system, with the load external. It's a second order system, with a force tracking goal. They consider filter-based accelerating estimation to negate passivity. In truth all latencies make passivity impossible, as the phase linearly drops with frequency. But they still use a first order filter to estimate velocity. With filters their impedance expression has sixth order polynomial denominator. In fact, they do seem to address phase delay in the differentiation. They provide simple rules to guarantee conservative controllers with cascaded structure. Their analysis forces integral gain to be very small, otherwise they would have problems with differentiation filtering.

% Demonstrates natural passivity of the cascade control structure. Derives range of renderable mechanical impedances. Also computes denominator polynomial. Uses hurwitz determinants as a stability criterion. Neglects parasitic effects, obviously. Does everything with PI instead of PD control, likely indicating that lower frequency crossover is sought.

Crowell2019TOEHF: U.S. Army Research Laboratory does assessments and evaluations for exoskeletons. Design guidance, refined metrics, gaps in knowledge.
+Augment strength and endurance+
Carrying heavy loads for long distances over terrain that cannot be traversed by vehicles.
+Military load carriage+
Challenges: unique equiptment that must be carried; variety of movements that must be accomodated; range of operational environments
Must promote systems that are safe for the user.
Gaps in knoledge: kinematic and kinetic data for use in system design; control system that anticipates movements and adapts to the user
Keywords: Exoskeleton, exosuit, military load carriage, dismounted warfighter, Warrior Web, TALOS
Army Research Lab, Human Research and Engineering Directorate (ARL, HRED)
Dismounted warfighter loads: [fighting load]: up to 44kg of clothing and equipment, [emergency approach march load] 68 kg. 
Load reduces mobility (Carlton & Orr, 2014), increases vulnerability to enemy fire (Billing, Silk, Tofari, & Hunt, 2015). 
Impaired tasks: 30m rush, sprint, crawl, casualty-drag, ammunition carry  (Jaworski et al., 2015; Loverro, Brown, Coyne, & Schiffman, 2015). Decreases situational awareness and marksmanship (Lim et al., 2017)  (Jaworski et al., 2015)
Loads increase musculoskeletal injury risk (Seay, 2015) and this results in non-deployable soldiers (e.g. in 2007 (Tyson, 2009)). lower extremities and back most common injuries (Orr, Johnston, Coyle, & Pope, 2015)
Biomechanical changes to gait (due to load) may be the cause (Brown, O’Donovan, Hasselquist, Corner, & Schiffman, 2014) and sudden stops (Ramsay, Hancock, O’Donovan, & Brown, 2016).
Meanwhile, shoulder and upper extremity injuries (Orr, Pope, Johnston, & Coyle,
2014) may be due to deformation of tissue (Hadid et al., 2017; McCulloch, Sheena, Simpson, & Power, 2014)
Document that exists: The Robotic and Autonomous Systems Strategy, it describes the Army's vision for using exoskeletons to lighten the burden on Soldiers (U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, 2017)
Exoskeletons can be defined broadly as wearable devices containing rigid components that enable, assist, or enhance motion or posture.
Exosuits are similar, but they consist mostly of flexible components that enable, assist, or enhance motion or posture.
1980-s Human Engineering Laboratory (HEL) proposal for exoskeleton to support life support, fire control, weapon, and power (Tullington, Butz, & Hill, 1987). Proposal was not funded, but well reviewed.
Human engineering design guidelines for exoskeletons (Crowell, 1995) + BAA on similar theme.
Sarcos was funded 1994-1996 on this, just making a sensor suit to collect the missing human movement data.
2000: DARPA announces Exoskeletons for Human Performance Augmentation (EHPA) program, aimed at compoenent level improvements: man-portable energy sources; power generation; controls and haptics; design integration. 

ARL estimated the torques needed for a load-bearing exoskeleton (Crowell, Boynton, & Mungiole, 2002) based on marching with the approach load (45 kg), then engaging with the fighting load (24kg),  and carrying the fighting load and searching every room and engaging in a three story building.

(Jansen et al., 2004) studied controls, cuffs, power, and actuation.
ARL studied boot-sole thickness (Boynton & Crowell, 2006), and used it to design a force-torque sensor. Boot thicknesses as large as 2 inches were supported by the study.
ARL-EXO winter from 2006-2012

2012-- DARPA Warrior web program, designed to have an exosuit under the uniform which would reduce energy expenditure by 25% in 20km marches). 9 devices tested: big names: Boston Dynamics RheAct, Joint Torque Augmentation Robot (JTAR) by SpringActive (Phoenix Arizona) [HollanderEA2014IDETC], Walk Assist Suit (WAS) by Wyss at Harvard, and others.. First gen eval paper (Neugebauer, Boynton,
Webster, Crowell, & LaFiandra, 2013)
Phase 2: SRI, SpringActive, Wyss, BDy+Ekso, U Delaware.
2013 -- Task B is augmentation: only Wyss (Awad et al., 2017; Ding, Kim, Kuindersma, & Walsh, 2018)
2015-2017 six evaluations of the 2 prototypes (ankle only, and ankle+hip) 
Final result, hip only, assisted in a 20 km loaded road march, reducing roughly 10% of energy expenditure

2014--SOCOM TALOS  (TALOS; Machi, 2018; Miles, 2014) is about survivability through body armor. ARL helped

List of surveys on military exoskeletons: {Gregorczyk et al., 2010; Kazerooni, Racine, Huang, & Steger, 2005; Mooney, Rouse, & Herr, 2014; Panizzolo et al., 2016}, concluding they are not ready for fielding. (Design challenges: (Herr, 2009; Young & Ferris, 2017))

Framing of design considerations (an Augmentation strategy consists of the following):
  Which joint(s) or muscle(s) to augment
  when to augment (in the gait cycle)
  how to augment (passive or active, magnitude and direction of torque vector)

Speeds: range of walking speeds (from Doctrine, 4km/h roads, 2.4km/h cross-country for 20-32 km) (from Warrior Web eval: 5.7 to 7.7 km/h over 20km course). Running: 12-13.2 km/h. needs to accomodate 0-13.2 km/h and handle freqeuent speed changes.

Load: 44kg and up to 68 kg in emergencies. Belive it to be important to model the effect of load on gait so as to properly adjust the relationship between walking phase and applied torque.

Other Movements: crawling, side-stepping, getting up from prone, sprinting, stepping up over and down, move-shoot. All of these movements change the phase-force relationship.

Interfaces: typically rigid cuff and elastic straps. Main challenge: must not cause discomfort ( pressure points, hot spots, blisters, chaffing, abrasions, bruising, nerve impingement, reductions in blood flow). 

Adjustability: importance of fit cannot be overstated. ineffective actuation to serious injury. muscle movements change diameter of body segments. Allow for minor adjustment during use.

Equipment compatibility: rucksack or assult pack, helmet, body armor, weapons, ammo, first aid supplies, items in pouches attached to the front and sides of the body armor vest. Vehicle entry/exit.

Safety: pinch, trip, snag hazards. hazard when shot or blasted. removal in case of injury. Noise, heat, EM signature minimization.

Control System: their mental model is that exoskeletons only work with one operator, and don't transfer well between people due to body dimensions, movement patterns, and general perception of motion, and even propensity for accepting technology.

User Controls: UI should be easy to access and protected from accidental actuation. Easy to operate with gloves, and intuitive so as not to add cognitive, perceptual, or physical load. Quickly change between modes of actuation or control. Stop switch for e-stop. 

Environmental conditions: weather resistant, 0-100% humidity, -40C to 50C, sunlight or total darkness, dust sand mud water

operate with current military power sources!? I googled and found the (unpriced) ELI-1614 Conformal Battery, Li-ion, 14Ah, 200Wh 14.4V (10-16.8 V), 1 Kg. (Comparable to airplane Lithium ion batteries around $200) (Turnigy High Capacity 16000mAh 4S 12C Lipo Pack w/XT90 $137.92, 14.8 V, 1.366 Kg, 16 Ah, 237 Wh)

Claims it is acceptible for early prototypes to have hydraulic cylinders, compressed air, or tethered electrical power.

Prototypes can have snag hazards, entanglement risks, lack of dust and moisture shielding, not designed to interface with body armor, ammo, rucksack, weapon.

30 minute trial period. Incremental increases in speed and load and grade. 24 to 48 hours of reset between training and evaluation.

Evaluation metrics for exoskeletons: Crowell et al. (2018) provides a compendium of methods and metrics that have been used previously to evaluate a number of exoskeleton and exosuit systems.

Biomechanical metrics quanitify differences in movement (joint angles, ground reaction forces)
Physiological metrics (electromyography, oxygen consumption) help to quanitify the exertion.
Operational metrics (task completion time, jump height) desribe functional capacity
Human factors metrics (anthropometrics, subjective surveys) quantify fit, comfort, and perception

No device (ND) vs. providing augmentation (ON) vs. not providing augmentation (OFF)

Research Direction suggestions:
  1) Collecting kinematic and force data for non-walking, non-running behaviors
  2) Physical interface (cuff) design
  3) Control system: system should not degrade agility, recognize movement intention, and anticipate movements.
  4) Standardized training, optimizing the number of training sessions, length of sessions, and time between sessions. What feedback should subjects receive?

Applications: Mobility Augmentation, Manual Material Handling, Tool Operation, Load Distribution (from shoulder to hips), Medical (automated first-aid and evac.), Capability Platform (extra armor, cooling, weapons, etc.), Postural Support, Shock and Vibration Damping, Training.

Saggitarius is therefore designed as a Capability Platform.

Physical performance (strength, endurance, agility)

From the terminology section:
Augmentation system = exoskeleton = wearable robot = wearable augmentation

Exoskeletons are rigid wearable devices (powered (active, semi-active), unpowered (passive, semi-passive))
Exosuit non-rigid wearable devices
Lower body augmentation 
passive = unpowered
semi-active is sometimes active and transparent during other times
semi-passive is sometimes passive and transparent at other times

Our metrics are not on the list of metrics for TRL 3-4 proof-of-concept devices.


Joint Moments --- product of force acting on a segment and the distance to joint center. Risk factor for injury (but not quite the same as human joint torque)
Joint Reaction Forces (JRF) --- the net force within the joint, not including muscle forces. Potential risk of injury with increases (Hewett et al. 2005; Milner et al. 2006)
Joint Contact Forces (JCF) --- net force within joint including muscle forces. Requires computer simulation to estimate muscle torques (Shelburne et al. 2005; Erdemir et al. 2007; Winby et al. 2009).
Joint Powers --- joint moment dot angular velocity is the rate of energy being absorbed or generated at the joint.

% Five Objectives: Situational Awareness (like drone-based-minimap); Lighten the Soldiers' physical and cognitive workloads, increase speed, mobility, stamina, and effectivenss, reduces leader information overload and decision fatigue, reduce cyber, electronic, and physical signatures; logistics; facilitate movement and maneuver; protect the force (for example by reducing the number of soldiers at risk near the front or in convoys).
Of the five capability objectives, the priority in the near-term is to increase situational awareness and lighten the Soldier's physical load, which will improve combat effectiveness of dismounted units

33% VO2 max is a NIOSH (pre-OSHA?) recommendation for 8-hour days of manual labor, like manual lifting. 50%ish is what people do when they need to work hard for a short time, and it decays towards 33% as the exercize slogs on. Sharp, Knapik, and Schopper (1994) studied a 45-hour continuous artillery drill, and VO2 started and 49% and decreased to 37% over the course of the---45 hour long---exercize.
Exoskeletons should fit 5% female to 95% male (to follow tradition?)
Range of motion should accomodate walking, carrying a load, and getting up from a fall.
Range of motion specifications (presuming a rigid structure for the exoskeleton):
  Foot toe pitch (Metacarpophalangeal extension) 90 degrees
  Ankle Flexion and extension: 35 flexion, 38 extension
  Knee flexion: 113 
  Hip flex and ex: 140 flexion, 15 extension
  Hip abd add: 30 abduction, 25 adduction
  Hip medial and lateral: 70 medial, 90 lateral
  pelvis rotation in coronal plane: 8 degrees
  pelvis rotation in saggital plane: 4 degrees
  pelvis rotation in transverse plane: 8 degrees
  spine flexion and extension (is mentioned)
  (stuff about arms)
Joint centers should align with human's joints
Actuators should be capable of maximum joint velocities and accelerations (though these are unknown)
Exoskeleton should not change the gait
Control system should operate with a delay of less than 3 to 5 ms (to facilitate a bandwidth comparable to the human's 46 ms recovery from disturbances)
Limbs must be counterbalanced or gravity compensated
Exoskeleton must stand by itself (!) but still be able to sway with the human (humans do not stand still) The exoskeleton should ignore this sway to avoid spending energy on it
The exoskeleton should be easy to use and maintain
To avoid the noise limit for hearing protection, the noise should be less than 85 dB(A). MIL-STD-1474C
Noise level should be tracked to the table in MIL-STD-1474C that relates detection distance to noise level.
Must include force feedback
Work required of the user must be less than 1/3rd or 1/2 of VO2 max
Attachments (cuffs) should not cause bruising, pressure sores, or abrasions
Must be easy to don and doff
Cuffs must be sweat resistant
Cuffs should avoid slippage when user is sweating or in the rain
Non-hazerdous fuel or exhaust
Heat shields around hot parts
Limits on lifting should be defined for the user
The exoskeleton must be designed to avoid exceeding the lifting limits, or at least warn the user
Exoskeleton should fail safe so that the user is not injured and can exit safely.

"The purpose of the high-level controller is to perceive the locomotive intent of the user through a combination of activity mode detection and direct volitional control."
"This shared control approach limits the cognitive burden imposed on the user"
"Force-feedback control measures the interaction force between the user and the device and acts to reduce it according to an assistance ratio. Zero-force or transparency control, also given the colloquial name “get-out-of-the-way control”, is a special case of force-feedback control"

Low level Control:
Impedance is defined as the transfer function between an input flow and an output effort [Hogan1985DSMC]. In the domain of mechanical rotation, controlling the impedance of a joint is to control the relationship between the accepted angular velocity and the yielded torque. Since the output of an impedance controlled joint is ultimately a torque, the output mechanical impedance of the actuator must be relatively low. A wide variety of virtual dynamics can be rendered under impedance control, with common intuitive examples being linear stiffness, damping and inertia. By applying passivity constraints to the rendered dynamics, the stability of the impedance-controlled system can be guaranteed [ColgateHogan1988IJC, ValleryEA2008RAM].

Admittance is defined as the inverse of impedance, and thus also defines a relationship between effort and flow. Admittance control has been proposed as an approach to masking the undesired dynamics (e.g. added friction and inertia) imposed by an exoskeletal device [Aguirre-OllingerColgatePeshkinGoswami2012NSRE]. This type of control has been used with treadmill-based gait orthoses [LunenburgerEA2005NSRE], but no examples of admittance control implementations with a portable device were found.

According to Dr Stephen Jacobsen, who leads the project, “The goal is to create an exoskeleton suit that enables humans to work inside robots instead of just alongside them”
MIT project (Walsh the grad student): load on the human back was reduced, but oxygen consumption went up!
BLEEX was teh world's first load-carrying lower extremity exoskeleton->Berkeley Bionics with HULC, ExoHiker and ExoClimber. HULC reduced V02 5-12 percent, 15 percent when carrying an 81 lb load (2mph).

"In order to be transparent, the exoskeleton must determine the user’s intent, apply forces when and where appropriate, and present low impedance to the wearer."
[alpha is the fraction of the perceived grf effort that the exoskeleton adds] "If it is set above one, then the exoskeleton will assist too much, requiring the user to work against the device to perform the task. " I think this is nominally unstable control which rails to maximum torque.

"""For force-based control, two different strategies are commonly applied. One is to perform an open-loop form of control such that a prespecified force or torque value is applied based on the assumed portion of the gait cycle. This strategy may incorporate other variables such as walking speed or step length to the formula but is difficult to optimize across multiple conditions such as jogging, slopes, and stairs A more responsive controller is a proportionally applied force/torque based on a specific sensor such as an EMG measurement from a relevant muscle or force sensor between the user and the exoskeleton. These are adaptable to different situations but difficult to implement in real-world devices. While it varies, a direct force strategy tends to be the preferred approach for human performance augmentation."""
"""The presence—or absence—of additional passive degrees of freedom within an exoskeleton has been largely unaddressed in the literature, but is critical to the success of a device. When walking in whole body exoskeletons, passive degrees of freedom (or the lack of them) drastically affect how encumbered the user is when attempting to maneuver and turn"""
